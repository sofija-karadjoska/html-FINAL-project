									<h3 id="top-of-page">Understanding Color</h3>
									<br/>								
									<p>Color theory is both the science and art of color. It explains how humans perceive color; how colors mix, match or clash; the subliminal (and often cultural) messages colors communicate; and the methods used to replicate color.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									Color is perception. Our eyes see something (the sky, for example), and data sent from our eyes to our brains tells us it’s a certain color (blue). Objects reflect light in different combinations of wavelengths. Our brains pick up on those wavelength combinations and translate them into the phenomenon we call color.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									When you’re strolling down the soft drink aisle scanning the shelves filled with 82 million cans and bottles and trying to find a six-pack of Coke, what do you look for? The scripted logo or that familiar red can?
									</p>								
									<br/>								
									<blockquote>
										<p>
										"People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on color. So, color plays a very important part."
										</p>

									<h3>The Color Wheel</h3>

										<p>										
											<br/>
											The first color wheel was designed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666. Artists and designers still use it to develop color harmonies, mixing and palettes.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											The color wheel consists of three <strong>primary colors</strong> (red, yellow, blue), three <strong>secondary colors</strong> (colors created when primary colors are mixed: green, orange, purple) and six <strong>tertiary colors</strong> (colors made from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).
										</p>
									</div>
									
								</div>
								<!-- <br/> -->
								<div class="warm_cool">
									<p>
										Draw a line through the center of the wheel, and you’ll separate the<strong> warm colors</strong> (reds, oranges, yellows) from <strong>cool colors</strong> (blues, greens, purples).
									</p>
									<br/>									
									<div class="warm_cool_img">
										<div class="warm">
											<img src="img/Warm-colors.png" alt="warm colors" height="443" />
										</div>
										<div class="cool">
											<img src="img/Cool-colors.png" alt="cool colors" height="443" />
										</div>
									</div>
									<br/>									
									<p>
										Warm colors create a sense of warmth and heat in an image or a design. When you see warm colors, you think of the sun, heat, fire, and love (passion). Red is the color of blood, which is warm, and orange and yellow go along with summer. Adding an orange photo filter to an image instantly makes it look warmer and happier.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										Cool colors carry connotations of cool climates, winter, death, sadness, ice, night, and water. Cool colors can be associated with calmness, tranquility, trust, cleanliness. Purple is associated with royalty, because they are supposed to be reserved.

									<h3>Hue, Shade, Tint, Tone</h3>
									<br/>
									<div class="hstt">
										<div id="hue">
											<img src="img/Hue.png" alt="hue" height="343"  />
										</div>
										<div id="shade">
											<img src="img/Shade.png" alt="shade" height="343"  />
										</div>
										<div id="tint">
											<img src="img/Tint.png" alt="tint" height="343"  />
										</div>
										<div id="tone">
											<img src="img/Tone.png" alt="tone" height="343"  />
										</div>									
									</div>
									<br/>
									<p>
										Simply put, tints, tones and shades are variations of <strong>hues</strong>, or colors, on the color wheel. A <strong>tint</strong> is a hue to which white has been added. For example, red + white = pink. A <strong>shade</strong> is a hue to which black has been added. For example, red + black = burgundy. Finally, a <strong>tone</strong> is a color to which black and white (or grey) have been added. This darkens the original hue while making the color appear more subtle and less intense.

									<h3>Color Schemes</h3>

											<h5>2 colors:

										<div id="analogous">
											<h4>Analogous</h4>
											<img src="img/Analogous.png" alt="analogous" height="299"  />

											<img src="img/Triadic.png" alt="triadic" height="299"  />
											<h5>3 colors:

											</h5>
										</div>			
									</div>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="blueh4">Complementary Colors</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Complementary colors</strong> are opposites on the color wheel—red and green, for example.Because there’s a sharp contrast between the two colors, they can really make imagery pop, but overusing them can get tiresome. Uusing a complementary color scheme in business marketing offers sharp contrast and clear differentiation between images.								
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="blueh4">Analogous Colors</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Analogous colors</strong> sit next to one another on the color wheel—red, orange and yellow, for example. When creating an analogous color scheme, one color will dominate, one will support and another will accent. In business, analogous color schemes are not only pleasing to the eye, but can effectively instruct the consumer where and how to take action.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="blueh4">Triadic Colors</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Triadic colors</strong> are evenly spaced around the color wheel and tend to be very bright and dynamic.
										Using a triadic color scheme in marketing creates visual contrast and harmony simultaneously, making each item stand out while making the overall image pop.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										With this basic knowledge about colors and color schemes, you’re prepared to make effective branding decisions. Like what color your logo should be. Or the emotions that colors evoke in a consumer and the psychology behind color choices on your website.Not only can knowledge of color theory guide you in your own marketing, it can also help you better understand what your competition is doing.

									<br/>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="redh4"><a href="#red">Red</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Red</strong> is the color of love and passion. Boxes of candies are red on valentines day. Some are pink, which is a tint of red. Red is also the color of anger and blood. Red, orange and yellow are all found in fire. Red can also mean danger. Stop signs are red, which get our attention and tell us to be careful and look before we proceed. Red is dominant, and when combined with colors such as black, can create a very masculine look. Red commands attention and can set a serious tone.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="orangeh4"><a href="#orange">Orange</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Orange</strong> represents warmth, but isn’t aggressive like red is. Orange can portray a fun atmosphere because it is energetic and creates a sense of warmth without associated connotations of danger and blood, as with the color red. Orange can be associated with health, such as vitamin C, which is commonly found in oranges.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="yellowh4"><a href="#yellow">Yellow</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Yellow</strong> is associated with the sun and warmth. When used with orange, it creates a sense of summer fun. Yellow can be associated with thirst, and can be found on the walls of many refreshment shops. Yellow can also be associated with cowardice and fear, which comes from the old expression of someone being “yellow.” When combined with black, it can gain a lot of attention. A good example outside of design would be a taxi. The combination gets a lot of attention.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="greenh4"><a href="#green">Green</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Green</strong> is the color of money, so in our culture it is associated with wealth. Since most plants are green, it is also associated with growth and health. It is used to show that products are natural and healthy, it also connotes profit and gain. Combined with blue, green further perpetuates health, cleanliness, life, and nature.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="blueh4"><a href="#blue">Blue</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										Depending on the tint and shade of <strong>blue</strong>, it can represent different feelings, thoughts, and emotions. In imagery, dark shades of blue can give a sense of sadness. An expression that goes along with this is “singing the blues” when someone is sad. Light blue is the color of the sky and of water, which can be refreshing, free, and calm. Blue skies are calming and tranquil. Water washes away dirt and cleans wounds. Blue can represent freshness and renewal, such as when rain washes away dirt and dust. The calmness of blue promotes relaxation.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="purpleh4"><a href="#purple">Purple</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										Associated from the color of the robes of royalty, <strong>purple</strong> relates to royalty. Purples with more red can be associated with romances, intimacy, softness, and comfort. Purple can give a sense of mystique as well as luxury. 
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="whiteh4"><a href="#white">White</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>White</strong> can be associated with sterility, due to doctors wearing white and most hospitals being white. Because most artistic depictions of religious figures are completely colorless, white represents “good” and holiness. White can represent cleanliness, such as clean linens and clean laundry. It can represent softness due to cotton and clouds. It can reference mental health due to the white coats and uniforms, white walls, etc. White is great for connoting health and cleanliness.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<h4 class="blackh4"><a href="#black">Black</a></h4>
									<br/>
									<p>
										<strong>Black</strong> is mostly associated with death, especially in the United States. It can represent decay — due to rot — based on how food breaks down and turns black. Black can represent evil, because it is the opposite of white, which often represents good. It can represent anxiety due to darkness and the unknown. A lot of black in an image can suggest depression and despair, as well as loneliness. However, despite all of the negative connotations, when combined with other colors, such as gold, it can represent luxury. Combined with silver or grey, it can represent sophistication
									</p>
									<br/>
									<br/>
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<br/>
									<p>
										It is essential to understand color as a designer. Everything that you design should take color into serious and careful consideration. The color choices that you make can create a drastic effect on the mood of your work. The right combination can gain attention and convey the right message visually, further driving the message into your viewers’ minds. The emotional side of design is extremely lucrative, and if you aren’t carefully considering your color choices, you should from now on. Your clients will see better results, and your message will have added clarity and strength. Color makes as much of a connection with people as imagery does.
